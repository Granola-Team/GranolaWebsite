### Mina FAQ

some frequently asked questions about the MINA protocol and why we use it

# *Why should developers build on Mina and not Ethereum?*

# *Why should developers build on Mina and not Aleo?*

# *Why should developers build on Mina and not Polygon?*

# *Can you provide a very succinct and relatable explanation of zero knowledge?*

# *What is a zkApp?*

# *What does it mean when you say Mina is a “succinct blockchain”?*

# *How is Mina’s blockchain only 22kB?*

# *What language are zkApps developed in? Is it hard to learn?*
- ZkApps are typically developed in the programming language Solidity, which is a contract-oriented programming language for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum platform. Solidity has its own unique syntax and features that one needs to learn. Usually programmers and software engineers learn Javascript/TypeScript before moving onto more difficult languages, such as Solidity.
- Mina recognized the challenges with building ZkApps with Solidity and has developed SnarkyJS. With Mina, zkApps are written in TypeScript using SnarkyJS. SnarkyJS is a TypeScript library for writing smart contracts based on zero-knowledge proofs for the Mina Protocol. It is included automatically when creating a new project using the Mina zkApp CLI.
- This link directly from Mina (https://docs.minaprotocol.com/zkapps/how-to-write-a-zkapp) provides a guide on how to write a ZkApp in Mina, including the steps for setting up the development environment, writing and testing the smart contract code, deploying the ZkApp to the Mina network, and using the ZkApp from a client. The guide also provides information on the tools and resources available for building and deploying ZkApps on Mina. Overall, the guide is intended to help developers get started with writing ZkApps on Mina, and to provide a comprehensive introduction to the concepts and tools required for building and deploying ZkApps on the Mina blockchain.

# *Is Mina EVM compatible?*

# *Does Mina have plans for a zkEVM?*

# *What are some top use case examples for zkApps?*
