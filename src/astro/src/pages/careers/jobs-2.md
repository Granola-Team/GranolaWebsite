# Role overview

Granola seeks a Senior Software Engineer to take responsibility for building novel software technology in the world of Web3 using primarily the Rust programming language.

### About Us

Granola Systems Inc. is a new and rapidly expanding software development consultancy. We build winning software teams using our expertise in software team leadership, DevOps, distributed systems, blockchain, functional programming, and data engineering. Our team is dispersed internationally and we welcome motivated self starters with a passion for solving problems.

### Profile

You, as Senior Software Engineer, will share responsibility for the delivery of product features, and for the accomplishment of team missions. You must be an inspirational communicator skilled at inducing productivity. This role requires that you understand very well how to engineer and deliver software; you could do it all yourself without a team, if you had more time. Coaching software development skills to teammates must be easy for you. You must thrive in an organisation that changes quickly, grows fast, and competes hard.

### Responsibilities

As a Senior Software Engineer, you will:

- Write code primarily in Rust, but also understand many other software tools and technologies.
- Have to enjoy learning new languages, tools, and technologies.
- Deliver and maintain software throughout its entire lifecycle.
- Act productively in a context of competing objectives.
- Promote an engineering environment with heavy emphasis on testing and testability.
- Morph DevOps processes to be more effective.
- Coach software engineers to improve professionally.
- Guide the development and the documentation of the code base so that it becomes more cloud-friendly, more developer-friendly, and easier to adopt.
- Help to transform the input of the Product team into engineering deliverables.
- Contribute to the software engineering hiring processes.
- Coordinate well in projects that cross organisational boundaries.

### Opportunity

This is your chance to join a small, collaborative team and to work on fascinating cross-disciplinary problems that span cryptography, data engineering, product design, economics, distributed systems, and more.
